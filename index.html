              There is a famous quote "Every great developer you know got there
              by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they
              actually did it." and I aspire to be the one. To start with I
              never thought I would like to write code, But I took a leap and
              Started my professional journey with Larsen and Toubro Infotech.
              To my surprise I never looked back. Me being a person who cannot
              live with monotony , my carrier choice gave me the kick I wanted
              to be on my toes and learn new things infinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked as a full stack developer for 5 years. I worked on web
              application for an insurance company. I got to work on huge
              variety of stack including Java, Javacript, Node.js, React, ExtJs
              , Sql , mongo db . I tried my hand on everything. As I continued
              to work , I learnt that anyone who knows the logic can write the
              code with all the help available on internet , but Its difficult
              to master it. Its easier to make changes to already built system
              but its difficult to build one from scratch. Knowing a language is
              different than mastering it. That's what triggered my masters
              journey. Masters introduced me to different carrier choices like
              data engineer, AI/ML developer and researcher. I am looking
              forward to try different trajectories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from my professional , Me as a person is very enthusiastic
              to know new people. Listening is the key to understand a person. I
              love to host house parties and also to cook on weekends for
              friends and family. I like visiting serene naturesque places. I
              like to read and watch content related to mystery genres. I am not
              involved in sport much nowadays , yet I have completed my black
              belt in taekwondo (form of karate).
